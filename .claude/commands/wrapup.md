End-of-session wrap-up. Run before stopping — sync docs, dispose of open findings, verify the reviewer fleet ran, and leave `main` clean for the next session. Scaled for this project; grow it as the project earns more (CI, a board, etc.).

## Checklist (report pass/fail with brief notes)

### 1. Docs sync (update in place)
- `HANDOVER.md` — reflects exactly where we stopped + the resume condition.
- `docs/plan.md` — status section and "next slice" are current.
- `docs/decisions.md` — every decision made this session is recorded (numbered, dated).
- `README.md` — the **Features** section lists every shipped user-facing feature (Decision 21;
  doc-updater's remit). Add/adjust an entry when a slice changes what the app does.

### 2. Findings disposition (no silent skips)
List EVERY open non-blocking finding from this session — cr-local skips, cloud CodeRabbit nitpicks, anything deferred, **and every open ISSUE/SUGGESTION from a reviewer in the fleet** (plan-critic, implementation-critic, semantic-reviewer, code-reviewer, red-team, doc-updater, test-writer, coderabbit-sync). (`db-security-reviewer`'s blockers are resolved at the `/fullpush` gate; `learner`'s proposals are dispositioned in §5.) For each, the user picks one:
- **FIX NOW** (< 10 lines) · **DEFER** → open a GitHub issue (`gh issue create`) · **SKIP** → with a reason.
- "Noted" is not a disposition — it's a ticket or an explicit skip.
- **Answer the cloud bot on the PR:** if there's an open PR with a cloud CodeRabbit review, run
  **`/coderabbit`** (triage each finding vs source → fix/defer/skip) → **`/fullpush`** (push the fixes)
  → **`/replycoderabbit`** (post the reply — one general comment, each finding citing its fix commit
  or skip/defer reason). Triage before reply; never leave a cloud-CR finding unanswered.

### 3. Repo hygiene
- `main` is clean (`git status`) and synced (`git status -sb` shows up-to-date with `origin`).
- No stray merged branches left behind (local or remote).
- No uncommitted work that should be saved; nothing half-done left unstated.
- **Secret hygiene** — no secrets were committed, logged, or echoed this session.

### 4. Task & memory
- Any `TaskCreate` tasks are completed or explicitly carried forward.
- Project memory is accurate and lean; stale entries removed.
- **Agent memory** (`.claude/agent-memory/*/MEMORY.md`) — curate in place: keep the pattern
  trackers accurate and lean, **transition** stale tracker rows to `RESOLVED`/`FALSE POSITIVE`
  (never *delete* a tracker row — per `agent-memory.md`), prune stale prose, and confirm no raw
  secrets/findings leaked in. Each `MEMORY.md` stays **under the 200-line / 25 KB budget** (spill
  durable detail to `topics/`); keep `red-team/topics/attack-surface.md` current. If the auth phase
  advanced this session (issue #3), flip **every** auth-phase artifact: the `db-security-reviewer`
  phase note, the `red-team` matrix rows (move `cross-user data access` / `owner-scoping` out of
  `pending (auth #3)`), and the `.coderabbit.yaml` `auth.uid()` qualifier.

### 5. Agent pipeline (the reviewer fleet — see `.claude/rules/agent-workflow.md`)
Two checks, both verifiable against the session transcript (list the evidence — don't rubber-stamp
"pass"). The reviewers are launched by hand, so this is the memory-jog that they actually ran.
- **Pipeline ran — name the reviewers per commit.** For each commit this session, list which
  reviewers ran and any **stated** skip, e.g. `abc123 → code-reviewer · semantic-reviewer ·
  doc-updater · test-writer · learner; red-team N/A (no migrations)`. Confirm `implementation-critic`
  ran before each commit and `plan-critic` before each plan approval (plan-critic may skip a
  <10-line single-file change — say so; implementation-critic never skips). Note any critic loop that
  hit the round **ceiling** (6 for plan/semantic/code; implementation-critic hands to the
  orchestrator at 2) — it must have been **escalated to the user**, not silently resolved.
- **`learner` proposals dispositioned** — any rule/doc/config change `learner` proposed was applied
  or **explicitly declined** (not "noted"). (`learner` emits proposals, not findings, so §2 doesn't
  cover it — this is the one fleet output dispositioned here.)

### 6. Session summary (present to user)
- **Done this session** — what shipped / merged.
- **Open / deferred** — with issue links.
- **Repo state** — branch, last commit, clean/synced.

### 7. Next-session hint
- What the next session should start with (the next slice), and any blocker to clear first.

## Why this exists
A session should end tidy: docs current, every finding dispositioned (not "noted"), `main` green and synced, and a clear starting point recorded — so the next session resumes in seconds, not archaeology.
