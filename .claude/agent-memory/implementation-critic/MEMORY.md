## Recurring deviations (none logged yet)
_First run pending. Seed watch-items carried from the project's conventions:_
- After an `await` in a `State`, is there `if (!mounted) return` before touching `context`/`setState`?
- `startMin`/`endMin` math — right unit (minutes from midnight, `0..1439`), both null iff `allDay`?
- Nullable model fields dereferenced without a guard (`Event.startMin`/`endMin`/`type`, `Contact.dob`)?
- Repository/model signature change → is the hand-written `_FakeXRepo` in `test/` updated too?
- Fallbacks match sibling code (`EventType` bad-hex → `#888888`; `toWrite()` empty → null)?
- `FutureBuilder` screens keep the `_lastData` stale-guard (failed refresh keeps stale data)?

## Positive signals
- Event-comments slice (2026-07-11): clean pre-commit review, 0 blocking. `_CommentsSection`
  faithfully mirrored the `event_types_screen.dart` `_load`/`_lastData`/`identical(future,_future)`
  stale-guard; `_run` captured `ScaffoldMessenger` before every await + re-checked `mounted`;
  `edit` sent `toWrite()` (event_id+body only, deleted_at untouched → can't accidentally
  (un)archive); migration matched plan (`select using(true)`, no delete grant, trigger reuse).
  When a new stateful list/section copies an existing green screen's load pattern verbatim, the
  stale-guard/mounted checks tend to be right — verify the copy is faithful rather than re-deriving.

- App-icon/name slice (2026-07-11, `slice/app-icon-and-name`): clean pre-commit review, 0 blocking.
  Config/asset-only (no Dart). Verified the way that actually catches the trap: decode the PNG alpha,
  don't trust colortype. Adaptive foreground (`crm-plus-dark-fg-1024.png` + generated
  `ic_launcher_foreground.png`) had corner alpha=0 = transparent glyph; legacy tile
  (`crm-plus-dark-1024.png`) corner alpha=255 rgb(10,10,10)=#0a0a0a opaque — correct split. colors.xml
  `#0a0a0a` matched `adaptive_icon_background`; anydpi-v26 refs resolved. For icon slices, pixel-sample
  corner-vs-center alpha rather than reading the SVG or PNG header alone.

## Known false-positive traps (do not flag these)
- Missing `auth.uid()` / login checks are expected pre-auth (issue #3) — not a defect.
- `with check (true)` policies and RPCs granted to `anon` are intentional pre-auth.
- `drop function if exists …; create or replace …` to change an RPC signature is the **correct**
  pattern here (avoids PGRST203), not a dropped-function regression.
- Hard `DELETE` on the annotated `event_attendees` join is allowed; soft-delete is only required
  on mutable entity tables.
