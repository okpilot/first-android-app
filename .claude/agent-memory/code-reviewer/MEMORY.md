# code-reviewer — memory

> Transition tracker, curated in place (never a dated session log). Records recurring Dart/Flutter

## Tracker table (recurring findings — rows transition, never delete)

| Pattern | First Seen | Count | Last Seen | Status (→ rule loc) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| _(none yet — first run pending)_ | | | | |

## Durable knowledge (this project's conventions to check against)
- **No hard line caps.** Judge structure by responsibility/nesting, not length. A long
  single-concern file (theme, a many-field model) is fine — say so, don't flag it.
- **`build()` composes; it does not fetch or compute.** Supabase/repo calls live in
  `lib/data/*_repository.dart`; heavy transforms in `lib/models/` or `lib/util/`. Flag placement
  only — logic correctness is `semantic-reviewer`'s.
- **List-screen state pattern:** `StatefulWidget` + `FutureBuilder` + `_lastData` stale-guard +
  `if (!mounted) return` after awaits (`calendar_screen.dart`, `contacts_list_screen.dart`,
  `event_types_screen.dart`). A new list screen should match it.
- **Shared atoms to reuse, not re-implement:** `EmptyState`, `TypeLabel`/`TypeDot`,
  `InitialsAvatar`. Colour-as-data (Decision 19): colour never rides alone.
- **Naming:** files `snake_case`, classes/enums `PascalCase`.
- **New pure-Dart util/model → flag missing test only; `test-writer` writes it.**

## Known false-positive traps (do not flag these)
- **Not a hard line cap** — a long file that is one cohesive concern is correct; do not flag length.
- **Generated / platform files** (`*.g.dart`, `*.freezed.dart`, `build/`, `android/…`, `web/…`) are
  not hand-authored — never flag them.
- **Legit `StatefulWidget`** — a screen that owns a `Future`/`_lastData`/`setState` is correct; only
  flag a `State` with no mutable field and no lifecycle.
- **Out of scope** — DB/RLS/SQL/secrets (`db-security-reviewer`), deep logic correctness
  (`semantic-reviewer`), lints `flutter analyze` already reports.

## Positive signals
- **`event_form_screen.dart`** — reference-quality form screen. `build()` composes a flat
  `ListView`; every visual concern extracted to a small private `StatelessWidget`
  (`_AllDayRow`, `_ValueField`, `_AttendeesSection`, `_TypeField`, `_TypePickerSheet`). Repo
  calls + time math live outside `build()`; every `await` has a `mounted` guard;
  `ScaffoldMessenger`/`Navigator` captured before the await in `_save`. Reuses `InitialsAvatar`
  / `TypeLabel` / `TypeDot` (colour-as-data honoured). 581 lines = one cohesive concern, NOT a
  cap violation. Use as the pattern to compare other form screens against.
