## Recurring plan failure modes (none logged yet)
_First run pending. Seed watch-items carried from the project's conventions:_
- Changing a model field or repository method → does the plan list the **test fake** in `test/`?
  (Injectable-repo hermetic tests mean a signature change usually needs a fake updated.)
- Touching `backend/migrations/` / an RPC / RLS → does the plan reference `docs/database.md`?
- Adding colour/labels → is it colour-**as-data** (Decision 19), not chrome?

## Positive signals
_None yet._

## Known false-positive traps (do not flag these)
- `drop function if exists …; create or replace …` to change an RPC signature is the **correct**
  pattern here (avoids PGRST203), not a breaking change.
- Missing `auth.uid()` is expected pre-auth (issue #3) — not a plan defect.
