# Handover

**Status: Contacts — the first REAL vertical slice — is BUILT and RUNNING END-TO-END on
Android (Flutter → supabase_flutter → local Postgres/PostgREST under RLS). Design principle
docs adopted. Android SDK installed from scratch. ALL work is LOCAL & UNPUSHED, on branch
`slice-1-walking-skeleton` (now used as the continuous dev line). Nothing on GitHub since
Decision 7.**

## How to bring the dev env back up (next session)
1. **Backend:** `cd backend && docker compose up -d` (data persists; `down -v` to re-seed).
   Health: `curl -s -H "apikey: $(grep SUPABASE_ANON_KEY .env|cut -d= -f2)" -H "Authorization: Bearer $(grep SUPABASE_ANON_KEY .env|cut -d= -f2)" http://127.0.0.1:8000/rest/v1/contacts?select=name`
   (If `backend/.env` / `dev-defines*.json` are missing, run `bash backend/gen-env.sh`.)
2. **Android env (not persisted in PATH):** `source ~/.android-env` in each shell. Then:
   - Emulator (windowed): `DISPLAY=:0 $ANDROID_HOME/emulator/emulator -avd pixel_api35 -gpu swiftshader_indirect &`
   - `adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000` (device→host tunnel; re-set after every emulator restart)
   - Run: `~/flutter/bin/flutter build apk --debug --dart-define-from-file=dev-defines.android.json && adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk && adb shell am start -n com.example.first_android_app/.MainActivity`
   - (`flutter run` can't attach its VM service inside this emulator — build+install+`am start` is the reliable path.)
3. **Web:** `~/flutter/bin/flutter run -d chrome --dart-define-from-file=dev-defines.json`
   (config now uses `127.0.0.1`, not `localhost`, to dodge the IPv6 `::1` issue.)

## Done this run (2026-07-08, session 2)
- ✅ **Adopted UI/UX principle docs** — lighter than first planned (2 critics said over-adopted): moved both encyclopedias into `docs/`, bound only the thin wrapper `docs/design-principles.md`; advisory-not-a-gate. Decision 9. Committed `f431822`.
- ✅ **Local dev backend** (`backend/`): Postgres + PostgREST + Caddy gateway (Supabase-shaped), `contacts` table + RLS + `soft_delete_contact` RPC + `updated_at` trigger + seed. All CRUD verified via curl. Decision 10.
- ✅ **Android SDK installed** portably (no sudo): JDK 17 `~/jdks`, SDK `~/Android/Sdk`, env `~/.android-env`; `android/` platform added; Pixel AVD `pixel_api35`. Decision 11.
- ✅ **Contacts feature** (Decision 12): injectable repository (`SupabaseContactsRepository` + fake for tests), list/detail/add-edit screens, loading/empty/error states, guarded soft-delete, date picker. Stock M3 (bespoke theme deferred).
- ✅ Runs end-to-end on the Android emulator (verified via `adb screencap` — 4 contacts load from Postgres). Local gate green (analyze + 5 tests + web build).
- 🐛 Bugs found & fixed: `setState`-returns-Future (caught by tests); `publishableKey` vs legacy anon JWT; **debug manifest clobbered Flutter's `INTERNET` permission** (the "Operation not permitted" fetch failures); `.order()` defaulted to desc.

## Loose ends / deferred
- ⏸️ **Everything unpushed** (user: "do not push, nothing"). When ready: split the local dev line into proper per-slice branches/PRs, run `/fullpush` + `/crlocal`, then push.
- ⏸️ **Ledger divergence:** `main` = Decision 7; this branch = Decisions 8–12. Reconcile at push time (fold onto main, or PR the branch) to keep the append-only ledger linear.
- ⏸️ **homebase deploy deferred** (Decision 10) — homebase was unreachable (SSH timeout). To run on a physical phone, either bind the local backend to the LAN IP, or deploy to homebase (public HTTPS).
- ⏸️ **Auth (GoTrue) deferred** to the first per-user slice; RLS policies are anon-permissive for now (tighten to owner-based then).
- ⏸️ Bespoke mono/Linear-Attio **theme** + **adaptive/two-pane** wide layout — candidate next slices.
- ⚠️ `flutter build linux` may still choke on the spaces in the absolute path (CMake/ninja) — untested; flag if we target Linux desktop.
- 🧹 Stray background `flutter run -d web-server` processes may linger from debugging (failed to bind :8080); harmless, `pkill -f "flutter run"` to clear.

## Done previous runs
- 2026-07-08 (s1): styling = stock M3 (Decision 8); planned + built the walking skeleton (parked).
- 2026-07-07: Flutter installed; LMS Plus conventions verified; foundation docs; pushed to github.com/okpilot/first-android-app; CodeRabbit adopted (PR #1); `/wrapup` added.
